I was never happy with the way the website looked, it was half finished and never really was how I wanted it to be. I use Jekyll hosted on Github Pages so went about trying to find a theme that would more suit my needs and stumbled across [Beautiful Jekyll](https://beautifuljekyll.com/). After playing around with the config and tweaking the css I'm liking the end result.

## The Godot Engine

Since I first started playing around with making games over a decade ago I've used Unity. I've always liked it and still do but the more I'm using Godot to more I'm liking the workflow.
